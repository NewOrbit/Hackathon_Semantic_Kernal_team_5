• Chronic cough such as occurs with smoking, asthma, chronic bronchitis or 
emphysema. 
Use with caution in patients taking the following medications (see Interactions) 
• vasoconstrictor agents such as ergot alkaloids (e.g. ergotamine and methysergide) 
• digoxin and cardiac glycosides 
Patients should stop using the product and consult a health care professional if cough 
lasts for more than 5 days or comes back, or is accompanied by a fever, rash or 
persistent headache. 
Do not take with a cough suppressant. 
This product should not be used by patients taking other sympathomimetics (such as 
decongestants, appetite suppressants and amphetamine-like psychostimulants) 
Concomitant use with alcohol, should be avoided. 
If symptoms persist consult your doctor. 
Do not exceed the recommended dose. 
Keep out of the sight and reach of children. 
Special label warnings
Contains paracetamol. Do not take anything else containing paracetamol whilst taking 
this medicine. Do not take more medicine than the label tells you to. Talk to a doctor 
at once if you take too much of this medicine, even if you feel well. If you do not get 
better, talk to your doctor. 
Special leaflet warnings
Contains paracetamol. Talk to a doctor at once if you take too much of this medicine, 
even if you feel well. This is because too much paracetamol can cause delayed, 
serious liver damage. 
Contains sunset yellow (E110) which may cause allergic-type reactions. 
Contains sorbitol (E420): Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose 
intolerance should not take this medicine. 
This medicinal product contains 31 mg of sodium per dose. To be taken into 
consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.

equivalent to 76 ml beer or 31.6 ml wine. 
Harmful for those suffering from alcoholism. 
To be taken into account in pregnant or breast-feeding women, children and high-risk 
groups such as patients with liver disease, or epilepsy. 
4.5 Interaction with other Medicinal products and Other Forms of 
Interaction 
The anticoagulant effect of warfarin and other coumarins may be enhanced by 
prolonged regular use of paracetamol with increased risk of bleeding; occasional 
doses have no significant effect. The hepato-toxicity of paracetamol may be 
potentiated by excessive intake of alcohol. The speed of absorption of paracetamol 
may be increased by metoclopramide or domperidone and absorption reduced by 
colestyramine. 
Pharmacological interactions involving paracetamol with a number of other drugs 
have been reported. These are considered to be of unlikely clinical significance in 
acute use at the dosage regimen proposed. 
Phenylephrine should be used with caution in combination with the following drugs 
as interactions have been reported: 
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
(including moclobemide) 
Hypertensive interactions occur between 
sympathomimetic amines such as 
phenylephrine and monoamine 
oxidase inhibitors (see contraindications). 
Sympathomimetic amines Concomitant use of phenylephrine with other 
sympathomimetic amines can increase the risk 
of cardiovascular side effects. 
Beta-blockers and other 
antihypertensives (including 
debrisoquine, guanethidine, 
reserpine, methyldopa) 
Phenylephrine may reduce the efficacy of betablocking drugs and antihypertensive drugs. 
The risk of hypertension and other 
cardiovascular side effects may be increased. 
Tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. 
amitriptyline) 
May increase the risk of cardiovascular side 
effects with phenylephrine. 
Ergot alkaloids 
(ergotamine and methylsergide) 
Increased risk of ergotism 
Digoxin and cardiac glycosides Increase the risk of irregular heartbeat or heart 
attack 
Warfarin and other coumarins The anticoagulant effect of warfarin and other 
coumarins may be enhanced by prolonged 
regular daily use of paracetamol with increased 
risk of bleeding; occasional doses have no 
significant effect. 
If urine is collected within 24 hours of a dose of this product, a metabolite may cause 
a colour interference with laboratory determinations of 5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-
HIAA) and vanillymandelic acid (VMA). 
4.6 Fertility, Pregnancy and lactation 
This product should not be used during pregnancy without medical advice. 
Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to 
paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice 
of their doctor regarding its use. The safety of guaifenesin and phenylephrine during 
pregnancy has not been established. 
Paracetamol and phenylephrine are excreted in breast milk but not in a clinically 
significant amount. This product should not be used whilst breastfeeding without 
medical advice. 
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Patients should be advised not to drive or operate machinery if affected by dizziness. 
4.8 Undesirable effects 
Adverse events from historical clinical trial data are both infrequent and from small 
patient exposure. Events reported from extensive post-marketing experience at 
therapeutic/labelled dose and considered attributable are tabulated below by 
MedDRA System Organ Class. Due to limited clinical trial data, the frequency of 
these adverse events is not known (cannot be estimated from available data), but postmarketing experience indicates that adverse reactions to paracetamol are rare and 
serious reactions are very rare. 
Body System Undesirable effect 
Blood and 
lymphatic system

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is 
important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal 
product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions 
via the Yellow Card Scheme at www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard or search for MHRA 
Yellow Card in the Google Play or Apple App store. 
4.9 Overdose 
Paracetamol 
Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10g or more of paracetamol. 
Ingestion of 5g or more of paracetamol may lead to liver damage if the patient has 
risk factors (see below). 
Risk factors: If the patient 
a) Is on long term treatment with carbamazepine, phenobarbitone, phenytoin, 
primidone, rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes. 
Or 
b) Regularly consumes ethanol in excess of recommended amounts. 
Or 
c) Is likely to be glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV 
infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms:
Symptoms of paracetamol overdosage in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, 
vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 
hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis 
may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, 
haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema, and death. Acute renal failure with 
acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, 
may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and 
pancreatitis have been reported. 
Management:
Immediate treatment is essential in the management of paracetamol overdose, even if 
symptoms of overdose are not present. Despite a lack of significant early symptoms, 
patients should be referred to hospital urgently for immediate medical attention. 
Symptoms may be limited to nausea or vomiting and may not reflect the severity of 
overdose or the risk of organ damage. Management should be in accordance with 
established treatment guidelines, see BNF overdose section. 
Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been 
taken within 1 hour. Plasma paracetamol concentration should be measured at 4 hours 
or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with Nacetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of paracetamol, however, 
the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The 
effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient 
should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage 
schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral methionine may be a suitable alternative 
for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious 
hepatic dysfunction beyond 24h from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or 
a liver unit. 
Phenylephrine 
Symptoms and signs
Phenylephrine overdosage is likely to result in effects similar to those listed under 
adverse reactions. Additional symptoms may include hypertension and possibly 
reflux bradycardia. In severe cases confusion, hallucinations, seizures and arrythmias 
may occur. However the amount required to produce serious phenylephrine toxicity 
would be greater than required to cause paracetamol-related toxicity. 
Treatment
Treatment should be as clinically appropriate. Severe hypertension may need to be 
treated with an alpha blocking drug such as phentolamine. 
Guaifenesin 
Symptoms and signs
Very large doses of guaifenesin cause nausea and vomiting. 
Treatment
Vomiting would be treated by fluid replacement and monitoring of electrolytes if 
indicated. 
5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
Paracetamol is an analgesic and antipyretic. 
Guaifenesin is an expectorant. 
Phenyleplrrine hydrochloride is a sympathomimimetic decongestant. 
The active ingredients are not known to cause sedation. 
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties 
Paracetamol is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is metabolised in the 
liver and excreted in the urine, mainly as glucuronide and sulphate conjugates. 
Guaifenesin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. It is rapidly metabolised by 
oxidation to β-(2 methoxy-phenoxy) lactic acid; which is excreted in the urine. 
Phenylephrine hydrochloride is irregularly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract 
and undergoes first-pass metabolism by monoamine oxidase in the gut and liver; 
orally administered phenylephrine thus has reduced bioavailability. It is excreted in 
the urine almost entirely as the sulphate conjugate. 
5.3 Preclinical safety data 
Preclinical safety data on these active ingredients in the literature have not revealed 
any pertinent and conclusive findings which are of relevance to the recommended 
dosage and use of the product and which have not already been mentioned elsewhere 
in this Summary.

cause liver failure which may require liver transplant or lead to death. 
The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. 
Medical advice should be sought before taking this product in patients with these 
conditions: 
• Occlusive Vascular disease (e.g. Raynaud’s Phenomenon) 
• Glutathione depletion due to metabolic deficiencies 
Use with caution in patients taking the following medications (see interactions). 
• digoxin and cardiac glycosides 
• ergot alkaloids (e.g. ergotamine and methysergide) 
This product should not be used by patients taking other sympathomimetics (such as 
decongestants, appetite suppressants and amphetamine-like psychostimulants). 
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose 
malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.

Patients should be advised not to take other paracetamol-containing or any other cold, 
flu or decongestant products concurrently. 
Medical advice should sought if symptoms worsen, persist for more than 7 days, or 
are accompanied by high fever, skin rash or persistent headache. 
Keep out of the reach and sight of children. 
Special label warnings
Do not take with other flu, cold or decongestant products. Do not take with any other 
paracetamol-containing products. 
Immediate medical advice should be sought in the event of an overdose, even if you 
feel well. 
Special leaflet warnings
Immediate medical advice should be sought in the event of an overdose, even if you 
feel well, because of the risk of delayed, serious liver damage. 
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
The speed of absorption of paracetamol may be increased by metoclopramide 
or domperidone and absorption reduced by colestyramine. The anticoagulant 
effect of warfarin and other coumarins may be enhanced by prolonged regular 
daily use of paracetamol with increased risk of bleeding, occasional doses 
have no significant effect. 
Phenylephrine should be used with caution in combination with the following 
drugs as interactions have been reported. 
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
(including moclobemide) 
Hypertensive interactions occur 
between sympathomimetic amines 
such as phenylephrine and 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors (see 
contraindications). 
Sympathomimetic amines Concomitant use of phenylephrine 
with other sympathomimetic amines 
can increase the risk of cardiovascular 
side effects. 
Beta-blockers and other 
antihypertensives (including 
debrisoquine, guanethidine, reserpine, 
methyldopa) 
Phenylephrine may reduce the 
efficacy of beta-blocking drugs and 
antihypertensive drugs. The risk of 
hypertension and other cardiovascular 
side effects may be increased. 
Tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. 
amitriptyline) 
May increase the risk of 
cardiovascular side effects with 
phenylephrine. 
Ergot alkaloids (ergotamine and methylsergide) 
increased risk of ergotism 
Digoxin and cardiac glycosides Increase the risk of irregular heartbeat 
or heart attack 
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation 
Due to the phenylephrine content this product should not be used in pregnancy 
or whilst breast-feeding without medical advice. This product should not be 
used during pregnancy or lactation unless the expected benefit to the mother 
justifies the potential risk to the foetus or newborn. The lowest effective dose 
and shortest duration of treatment should be considered. Phenylephrine may be 
excreted in breast milk. 
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Patients should be advised not to drive or operate machinery if affected by 
dizziness. 
4.8 Undesirable effects 
Paracetamol 
Adverse events from historical clinical trial data are both infrequent and from 
small patient exposure. Accordingly, events reported from extensive postmarketing experience at therapeutic/labelled dose and considered attributable 
are tabulated below by system class. Due to limited clinical trial data, the 
frequency of these adverse events is not known (cannot be estimated from 
available data), but post-marketing experience indicates that adverse reactions 
to paracetamol are rare and serious reactions are very rare. 
Body System Undesirable effect 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders Thrombocytopenia, 
agranulocytosis. 
These are not necessarily causally 
related to paracetamol 
Immune system disorders Anaphylaxis, 
Cutaneous hypersensitivity 
reactions, including skin rashes, 
angioedema and Stevens Johnson 
syndrome / toxic epidermal 
necrolysis 
Very rare cases of serious skin 
reactions have been reported. 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders 
Bronchospasm* 
Hepatobiliary disorders Hepatic dysfunction 
* There have been cases of bronchospasm with paracetamol, but these are 
more likely in asthmatics sensitive to aspirin or other NSAIDs. 
Phenylephrine 
The following adverse events have been observed in clinical trials with 
phenylephrine and may therefore represent the most commonly occurring 
adverse events. 
Body System Undesirable effect 
Psychiatric disorders Nervousness, irritability, restlessness, and 
excitability 
Nervous system disorders Headache, dizziness, insomnia 
Cardiac disorders Increased blood pressure 
Gastrointestinal disorders Nausea, Vomiting. 
Adverse reactions identified during post-marketing use are listed below. The 
frequency of these reactions is unknown but likely to be rare. 
Eye disorders Mydriasis, acute angle closure glaucoma, 
most likely to occur in those with closed 
angle glaucoma 
Cardiac disorders Tachycardia, palpitations 
Skin and subcutaneous 
disorders 
Allergic reactions (e.g. rash, urticaria, 
allergic dermatitis). Hypersensitivity 
reactions – including that cross-sensitivity 
may occur with other sympathomimetics 
Renal and urinary disorders Dysuria, urinary retention. This is most likely 
to occur in those with bladder outlet 
obstruction, such as prostatic hypertrophy. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal 
product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance 
of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any 
suspected adverse reactions via the Yellow Card Scheme at 
www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the 
Google Play or Apple App store. 
4.9 Overdose 
Paracetamol
Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10g or more of 
paracetamol. Ingestion of 5g or more of paracetamol may lead to liver damage 
if the patient has risk factors (see below). 
Risk factors: 
If the patient 
a. Is on long term treatment with carbamazepine, phenobarbitone, phenytoin, 
primidone, rifampicin, St John's Wort or other drugs that induce liver 
enzymes. 
OR 
b. Regularly consumes ethanol in excess of recommended amounts. 
OR 
c. Is likely to be glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV 
infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms: 
Symptoms of paracetamol overdosage in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, 
vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 
12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and 
metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may 
progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema, 
and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested 
by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of 
severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. 
Management: 
Immediate treatment is essential in the management of paracetamol overdose. 
Despite a lack of significant early symptoms, patients should be referred to 
hospital urgently for immediate medical attention. Symptoms may be limited 
to nausea or vomiting and may not reflect the severity of overdose or the risk 
of organ damage. Management should be in accordance with established 
treatment guidelines, see BNF overdose section. 
Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has 
been taken within 1 hour. Plasma paracetamol concentration should be 
measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are 
unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after 
ingestion of paracetamol, however, the maximum protective effect is obtained 
up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines 
sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous Nacetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not 
a problem, oral methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, 
outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic 
dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the 
NPIS or a liver unit. 
Phenylephrine Hydrochloride
Symptoms and signs:
Phenylephrine overdosage is likely to result in effects similar to those listed 
under adverse reactions. Additional symptoms may include hypertension and 
possibly reflux bradycardia. In severe cases confusion, hallucinations, seizures 
and arrythmias may occur. However the amount required to produce serious 
phenylephrine toxicity would be greater than required to cause paracetamolrelated toxicity. 
Treatment
Treatment should be as clinically appropriate. Severe hypertension may need 
to be treated with an alpha blocking drug such as phentolamine. 
5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
Paracetamol provides the analgesic and antipyretic actions. 
Phenylephrine Hydrochloride is a sympathomimetic agent and provides relief 
from nasal congestion due to its vasoconstrictor action. 
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties 
Paracetamol - Is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is 
metabolised in the liver and excreted in the urine, mainly as glucuronide and 
sulphate conjugates. 
Phenylephrine Hydrochloride - Due to irregular absorption and first pass 
metabolism by monoamine oxidase in the gut and liver, phenylephrine has 
reduced bioavailability from the gastrointestinal tract. It is excreted in the 
urine almost entirely as the sulphate conjugate. 
5.3 Preclinical safety data 
None stated.

4.3 Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to paracetamol, caffeine or any of the other constituents. 
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take this 
medicine. 
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
Do not exceed the stated dose. 
Contains paracetamol. Do not use with any other paracetamol containing 
products. The concomitant use with other products containing paracetamol may 
lead to an overdose. 
Paracetamol overdose may cause liver failure which may require liver transplant 
or lead to death. 
Care is advised in the administration of paracetamol to patients with renal or 
hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic 
alcoholic liver disease. 
Caution should be exercised in patients with glutathione depleted states, as the 
use of paracetamol may increase the risk of metabolic acidosis (see section 4.9). 
Excessive intake of caffeine (e.g. coffee, tea and some canned drinks) should be 
avoided while taking this product. 
This medicinal product contains 854 mg sodium per dose (2 tablets) equivalent to 
42.7% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an 
adult. 
Each tablet contains sorbitol powder (E 420) at 50 mg per tablet. 
Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance should not take this medicine. 
If symptoms persist, medical advice must be sought. 
Keep out of the sight and reach of children. 
Pack Label:
Talk to a doctor at once if you take too much of this medicine, even if you feel 
well. Do not take anything else containing paracetamol while taking this 
medicine. 
Patient Information Leaflet:
Talk to a doctor at once if you take too much of this medicine even if you feel 
well. This is because too much paracetamol can cause delayed, serious liver 
damage. 
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
The speed of absorption of paracetamol may be increased by metaclopramide or 
domperidone and absorption reduced by colestyramine. The anticoagulant effect of 
warfarin and other coumarins may be enhanced by prolonged regular daily use of 
paracetamol with increased risk of bleeding; occasional doses have no significant 
effect. Caffeine may increase clearance of lithium. Concomitant use is therefore not 
recommended. 
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation 
Paracetamol-caffeine is not recommended for use during pregnancy due to the 
possible increased risk of lower birth weight and spontaneous abortion 
associated with caffeine consumption. 
Caffeine in breast milk may potentially have a stimulating effect on breast fed 
infants. 
Due to the caffeine content of this product it should not be used if you are 
pregnant or breast feeding. 
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
None. 
4.8 Undesirable effects 
Adverse events from historical clinical trial data are both infrequent and from small 
patient exposure. Accordingly, events reported from extensive post- marketing 
experience at therapeutic/labelled dose and considered attributable are tabulated 
below by MedDRA System Organ Class. Adverse reactions identified during post-
marketing use are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, the 
frequency of these reactions is unknown but likely to be very rare (<1/10,000).

Yellow Card in the Google Play or Apple App store. 
4.9 Overdose 
Paracetamol
Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of paracetamol. 
Ingestion of 
5g or more of paracetamol may lead to liver damage if the patient has risk factors (see 
below).
Risk factors 
If the patient 
a) Is on long term treatment with carbamazepine, phenobarbitone, phenytoin, 
primidone, rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes. 
or 
 
b) Regularly consumes ethanol in excess of recommended amounts. 
or 
c) Is likely to be glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV 
infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms 
Symptoms of paracetamol overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, 
anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours 
after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may 
occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, 
haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with 
acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, 
may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrythmias and

Immediate treatment is essential in the management of paracetamol overdose. 
Despite a lack of significant early symptoms, patients should be referred to hospital 
urgently for immediate medical attention. Symptoms may be limited to nausea or 
vomiting and may not reflect the severity of the overdose or the risk of organ damage. 
Management should be in accordance with established treatment guidelines, see BNF 
overdose section. 
Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been 
taken within 1 hour. Plasma paracetamol concentration should be measured at 4 hours 
or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with Nacetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of paracetamol, however,

should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage 
schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral methionine may be a suitable alternative 
for remote areas outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious 
hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 h from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or 
a liver unit. 
Caffeine
Symptoms 
Overdose of caffeine may result in epigastric pain, vomitting, diuresis, tachycardia or 
cardia arrhythmia, CNS stimulation (insomnia, restlessness, excitement, agitation, 
jitteriness, tremors and convulsions). 
It must be noted that for clinically significant symptoms of caffeine overdose to occur 
with this product, the amount ingested would be associated with serious paracetamolrelated toxicity 
Management 
Patients should receive general supportive care (e.g. hydration and maintenance of 
vital signs). The administration of activated charcoal may be beneficial when 
performed within one hour of the overdose, but can be considered for up to four hours 
after the overdose. The CNS effects of overdose may be treated with intravenous 
sedatives. 
Sodium bicarbonate
High doses of sodium bicarbonate may be expected to induce gastrointestinal 
symptoms including belching and nausea. In addition, high doses of sodium 
bicarbonate may cause hypernatraemia; electrolytes should be monitored and patients 
managed accordingly. 
5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
The combination of paracetamol and caffeine is a well established analgesic 
combination. 
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties 
Paracetamol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastro-intestinal 
tract. It is relatively uniformly distributed throughout most body fluids and exhibits 
variable protein binding. Excretion is almost exclusively renal in the form of 
conjugated metabolites. 
Caffeine is absorbed readily after oral administration, maximal plasma concentrations 
are achieved within one hour and the plasma half-life is about 3.5 hours. 65 -–80% of 
administered caffeine is excreted in the urine as 1-methyluric acid and 1-
methylxanine. 
5.3 Preclinical safety data 
There are no preclinical data of relevance to the prescriber which are additional to 
that already included in other sections of the SPC.

Immediate medical advice should be sought in the event of an overdose, even 
if you feel well. 
Special leaflet warnings
Immediate medical advice should be sought in the event of an overdose, even 
if you feel well, because of the risk of delayed, serious liver damage. 
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
The speed of absorption of paracetamol may be increased by metoclopramide 
or domperidone and absorption reduced by colestyramine. The anticoagulant 
effect of warfarin and other coumarins may be enhanced by prolonged regular 
daily use of paracetamol with increased risk of bleeding, occasional doses 
have no significant effect. 
Phenylephrine should be used with caution in combination with the following 
drugs as interactions have been reported 
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
(including moclobemide) 
Hypertensive interactions occur 
between sympathomimetic amines 
such as phenylephrine and monoamine 
oxidase inhibitors (see 
contraindications). 
Sympathomimetic amines Concomitant use of phenylephrine 
with other sympathomimetic amines 
can increase the risk of cardiovascular 
side effects. 
Beta-blockers and other 
antihypertensives (including 
debrisoquine, guanethidine, 
reserpine, methyldopa) 
Phenylephrine may reduce the efficacy 
of beta-blocking drugs and 
antihypertensive drugs. The risk of 
hypertension and other cardiovascular 
side effects may be increased. 
Tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. 
amitriptyline) 
May increase the risk of 
cardiovascular side effects with 
phenylephrine. 
Ergot alkaloids (ergotamine and methylsergide) 
increased risk of ergotism 
Digoxin and cardiac glycosides Increase the risk of irregular heartbeat 
or heart attack 
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation 
Due to the phenylephrine content this product should not be used in pregnancy 
or whilst breast-feeding without medical advice. This product should not be 
used during pregnancy or lactation unless the expected benefit to the mother 
justifies the potential risk to the foetus or newborn. The lowest effective dose 
and shortest duration of treatment should be considered. Phenylephrine may 
be excreted in breast milk. 
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Patients should be advised not to drive or operate machinery if affected by dizziness. 
4.8 Undesirable effects 
Paracetamol
Adverse events from historical clinical trial data are both infrequent 
and from small patient exposure. Accordingly, events reported 
from extensive post- marketing experience at therapeutic/labelled 
dose and considered attributable are tabulated below by system 
class. Due to limited clinical trial data, the frequency of these 
adverse events is not known (cannot be estimated from available 
data), but post-marketing experience indicates that adverse 
reactions to paracetamol are rare and serious reactions are very 
rare. 
Body System Undesirable effect
Blood and lymphatic system 
disorders 
Thrombocytopenia 
Agranulocytosis 
These are not necessarily causally related to 
paracetamol 
Immune system disorders Anaphylaxis
Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions 
including skin rashes, angioedema and 
Stevens Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal 
necrolysis 
Very rare cases of serious skin reactions have 
been reported. 
Respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders 
Bronchospasm in patients sensitive to 
aspirin and other NSAIDs 
Hepatobiliary disorders Hepatic dysfunction 
* There have been cases of bronchospasm with paracetamol, but these are 
more likely in asthmatics sensitive to aspirin or other NSAIDs. 
Phenylephrine
The following adverse events have been observed in clinical 
trials with phenylephrine and may therefore represent the most 
commonly occurring adverse events. 
Body System Undesirable effect
Psychiatric disorders Nervousness, irritability, restlessness, and 
excitability 
Nervous system disorders Headache, dizziness, insomnia 
Cardiac disorders Increased blood pressure 
Gastrointestinal disorders Nausea, Vomiting, diarrhoea 
Adverse reactions identified during post-marketing use are listed 
below. The frequency of these reactions is unknown but likely to 
be rare. 
Eye disorders Mydriasis, acute angle closure glaucoma, 
most likely to occur in those with closed 
angle glaucoma 
Cardiac disorders Tachycardia, palpitations 
Skin and subcutaneous 
disorders 
Allergic reactions (e.g. rash, urticaria, 
allergic dermatitis). 
Hypersensitivity reactions – including that 
cross-sensitivity may occur with other 
sympathomimetics 
Renal and urinary disorders Dysuria, urinary retention. This is most 
likely to occur in those with bladder outlet 
obstruction, such as prostatic hypertrophy. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal 
product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk 
balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report 
any suspected adverse reactions via the Yellow Card Scheme at 
www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the 
Google Play or Apple App store. 
4.9 Overdose 
Paracetamol
Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10g or more of 
paracetamol. Ingestion of 5g or more of paracetamol may lead to liver damage 
if the patient has risk factors (see below). 
Risk factors:
If the patient 
a, Is on long term treatment with carbamazepine, phenobarbitone, phenytoin, 
primidone, rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver 
enzymes. 
Or 
b, Regularly consumes ethanol in excess of recommended amounts. 
Or 
c, Is likely to be glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV 
infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms:
Symptoms of paracetamol overdosage in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, 
vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 
12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and 
metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may 
progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema, 
and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested 
by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of 
severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. 
Management:
Immediate treatment is essential in the management of paracetamol overdose. 
Despite a lack of significant early symptoms, patients should be referred to 
hospital urgently for immediate medical attention. Symptoms may be limited 
to nausea or vomiting and may not reflect the severity of overdose or the risk 
of organ damage. Management should be in accordance with established 
treatment guidelines, see BNF overdose section. 
Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has 
been taken within 1 hour. Plasma paracetamol concentration should be 
measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are 
unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after 
ingestion of paracetamol, however, the maximum protective effect is obtained 
up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply 
after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous Nacetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not 
a problem, oral methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, 
outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic 
dysfunction beyond 24h from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or 
a liver unit. 
Phenylephrine
Symptoms and signs
Phenylephrine overdosage is likely to result in effects similar to those listed 
under advserse reactions. Additional symptoms may include hypertension and 
possibly reflux bradycardia. In severe cases confusion, hallucinations, seizures 
and arrythmias may occur. However the amount required to produce serious 
phenylephrine toxicity would be greater than required to cause paracetamolrelated toxicity. 
Treatment
Treatment should be as clinically appropriate. Severe hypertension may need 
to be treated with an alpha blocking drug such as phentolamine. 
Ascorbic acid
Symptoms and signs
High doses of ascorbic acid (>3000 mg) may cause transient osmotic 
diarrhoea and gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and abdominal 
discomfort. Effects of overdose of ascorbic acid would be subsumed by severe 
liver toxicity caused by paracetamol overdose. 
Pharmacological Properties 
5.1. Pharmacodynamic Properties 
Paracetamol - an analgesic and antipyretic. 
Ascorbic acid - a common ingredient of cold and influenza combination 
products included to compensate for Vitamin C losses which may occur in the 
initial stages of acute viral infections. 
Phenylephrine hydrochloride - a sympathomimetic decongestant. 
The active ingredients are not known to cause sedation. 
5.2. Pharmacokinetic Properties 
Paracetamol - is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is 
metabolised in the liver and excreted in the urine, mainly as glucuronide and 
sulphate conjugates. 
Ascorbic Acid - is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is 
widely distributed in the body tissues, 25% bound to plasma proteins. 
Ascorbic Acid in excess of the body's needs is eliminated in the urine as 
metabolites. 
Phenylephrine hydrochloride - is irregularly absorbed from the gastrointestinal 
tract and undergoes first-pass metabolism by monoamine oxidase in the gut 
and liver; orally administered phenylephrine thus has reduced bioavailability. 
It is excreted in the urine almost entirely as the sulphate conjugate. 
5.3. Preclinical Safety Data 
Pre-clinical safety data on these active ingredients in the literature have not 
revealed any pertinent and conclusive findings which are of relevance to the 
recommended dosage and use of the product and which have not already been 
mentioned elsewhere in this Summary 
The toxicity of paracetamol has been extensively studied in numerous animal 
species. Pre-clinical studies in rats and mice have indicated single dose oral 
LD50 values of 3.7 g/kg and 338 mg/kg, respectively. Chronic toxicity in 
these species at large multiples of the human therapeutic dose, occurs as 
degeneration and necrosis of hepatic, renal and lymphoid tissue, and blood 
count changes. The metabolites believed responsible for these effects have 
also been demonstrated in man. Paracetamol should not, therefore, be taken 
for long periods of time, and in excessive doses. At normal therapeutic doses, 
paracetamol is not associated with genotoxic or carcinogenic risk. There is no 
evidence of embryo- or foeto-toxicity from paracetamol in animal studies.

4.2 Posology and method of administration 
4.2 Posology and method of administration 
Posology
Adults 
One tablet once daily. 
Paediatric population
Children 6 years of age and older with a body weight greater than 30 kg: 
One tablet once daily. 
For appropriate dosing in children younger than 6 years or with body weight of 30 kg 
or less, there are other formulations more suitable. 
Children under 2 years of age: 
The safety and efficacy of Clarityn Allergy Tablets have not been established. No 
data are available. 
Patients with hepatic impairment
Patients with severe liver impairment should be administered a lower initial dose 
because they may have reduced clearance of loratadine. An initial dose of 10 mg 
every other day is recommended for adults and children weighing more than 30 
kg. 
Patients with renal impairment
No dosage adjustments are required in patients with renal insufficiency. 
Elderly
No dosage adjustments are required in the elderly. 
Method of administration
Oral use. The tablet may be taken without regard to mealtime. 
4.3 Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 
6.1. 
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
Clarityn Allergy Tablets should be administered with caution in patients with severe 
liver impairment (see section 4.2). 
This medicinal product contains lactose; thus patients with rare hereditary problems 
of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose 
malabsorption should not take this medicine. 
The administration of Clarityn Allergy Tablets should be discontinued at least 48 
hours before skin tests since antihistamines may prevent or reduce otherwise positive 
reactions to dermal reactivity index. 
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
When administered concomitantly with alcohol, Clarityn Allergy Tablets have no 
potentiating effects as measured by psychomotor performance studies. 
Potential interaction may occur with all known inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 
resulting in elevated levels of loratadine (see Section 5.2), which may cause an 
increase in adverse events. 
Increase in plasma concentrations of loratadine has been reported after concomitant 
use with ketoconazole, erythromycin, and cimetidine in controlled trials, but without 
clinically significant changes (including electrocardiographic). 
Paediatric population
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy
A large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1000 exposed 
outcomes) indicate no malformative nor feto/ neonatal toxicity of loratadine. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Clarityn 
Allergy Tablets during pregnancy. 
Breastfeeding
Loratadine is excreted in breast milk. Therefore, the use of Clarityn Allergy Tablets is 
not recommended in breast-feeding women. 
Fertility
There are no data available on male and female fertility. 
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
In clinical studies that assessed driving ability, no impairment was observed in 
patients receiving loratadine. Clarityn Allergy Tablets has no or negligible influence 
on the ability to drive and use machines. However, patients should be informed that 
very rarely some people experience drowsiness, which may affect their ability to 
drive or use machines. 
4.8 Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile
In clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in a range of indications including 
allergic rhinitis (AR) and chronic idiopathic urticarial (CIU), at the recommended 
dose of 10mg daily, adverse reactions with loratadine were reported in 2% of patients 
in excess of those treated with placebo. The most frequent adverse reactions reported 
in excess of placebo were somnolence (1.2%), headache (0.6%), increased appetite 
(0.5%) and insomnia (0.1%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The following adverse reactions reported during the post-marketing period are listed 
in the following table by System Organ Class. Frequencies are defined as very 
common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), 
rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be 
estimated from the available data). 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of 
decreasing seriousness.

Paediatric population
In clinical trials in a paediatric population, children aged 2 through 12 years, common 
adverse reactions reported in excess of placebo were headache (2.7%), nervousness 
(2.3%), and fatigue (1%). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is 
important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal 
product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions 
via the Yellow Card Scheme, website www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard. 
4.9 Overdose 
Overdosage with loratadine increased the occurrence of anticholinergic symptoms. 
Somnolence, tachycardia and headache have been reported with overdoses. 
In the event of overdose, general symptomatic and supportive measures are to be 
instituted and maintained for as long as necessary. Administration of activated 
charcoal as a slurry with water may be attempted. Gastric lavage may be considered. 
Loratadine is not removed by haemodialysis and it is not known if loratadine is 
removed by peritoneal dialysis. Medical monitoring of the patient is to be continued 
after emergency treatment. 
5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antihistamines – H1 antagonist, ATC code : R06A X13. 
Mechanism of action
Loratadine, the active ingredient in Clarityn Allergy Tablets, is a tricyclic 
antihistamine with selective, peripheral H1-receptor activity. 
Pharmacodynamic effects
Loratadine has no clinically significant sedative or anticholinergic properties in the 
majority of the population and when used at the recommended dosage. 
During long-term treatment there were no clinically significant changes in vital signs, 
laboratory test values, physical examinations or electrocardiograms. 
Loratadine has no significant H2-receptor activity. It does not inhibit norepinephrine 
uptake and has practically no influence on cardiovascular function or on intrinsic 
cardiac pacemaker activity. 
Human histamine skin wheal studies following a single 10 mg dose has shown that 
the antihistamine effects are seen within 1-3 hours reaching a peak at 8-12 hours and 
lasting in excess of 24 hours. There was no evidence of tolerance to this effect after 
28 days of dosing with loratadine. 
Clinical efficacy and safety
Over 10,000 subjects (12 years and older) have been treated with loratadine 10 mg 
tablets in controlled clinical trials. Loratadine 10 mg tablets once daily was superior 
to placebo and similar to clemastine in improving the effects on nasal and non-nasal 
symptoms of AR. In these studies somnolence occurred less frequently with 
loratadine than with clemastine and about the same frequency as terfenadine and 
placebo. 
Among these subjects (12 years and older), 1000 subjects with CIU were enrolled in 
placebo controlled studies. A once daily 10 mg dose of loratadine was superior to 
placebo in the management of CIU as demonstrated by the reduction of associated 
itching, erythema and hives. In these studies the incidence of somnolence with 
loratadine was similar to placebo. 
Paediatric population
Approximately 200 paediatric subjects (6 to 12 years of age) with seasonal allergic 
rhinitis received doses of loratadine syrup up to 10 mg once daily in controlled 
clinical trials. In another study, 60 paediatric subjects (2 to 5 years of age) received 5 
mg of loratadine syrup once daily. No unexpected adverse events were observed. 
The paediatric efficacy was similar to the efficacy observed in adults. 
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption
Loratadine is rapidly and well-absorbed. Concomitant ingestion of food can delay 
slightly the absorption of loratadine but without influencing the clinical effect. The 
bioavailability parameters of loratadine and of the active metabolite are dose 
proportional. 
Distribution
Loratadine is highly bound (97% to 99%) and its active major metabolite 
desloratadine (DL) moderately bound (73% to 76%) to plasma proteins. 
In healthy subjects, plasma distribution half-lives of loratadine and its active 
metabolite are approximately 1 and 2 hours, respectively. 
Biotransformation
After oral administration, loratadine is rapidly and well absorbed and undergoes an 
extensive first pass metabolism, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. The major 
metabolite-desloratadine (DL)- is pharmacologically active and responsible for a 
large part of the clinical effect. Loratadine and DL achieve maximum plasma 
concentrations (Tmax) between 1–1.5 hours and 1.5–3.7 hours after administration, 
respectively. 
Elimination
Approximately 40% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 42% in the faeces over a 
10 day period and mainly in the form of conjugated metabolites. Approximately 27% 
of the dose is eliminated in the urine during the first 24 hours. Less than 1% of the 
active substance is excreted unchanged in active form, as loratadine or DL. 
The mean elimination half-lives in healthy adult subjects were 8.4 hours (range = 3 to 
20 hours) for loratadine and 28 hours (range = 8.8 to 92 hours) for the major active 
metabolite. 
Renal impairment
In patients with chronic renal impairment, both the AUC and peak plasma levels 
(Cmax) increased for loratadine and its active metabolite as compared to the AUCs and 
peak plasma levels (Cmax) of patients with normal renal function. The mean 
elimination half-lives of loratadine and its active metabolite were not significantly 
different from that observed in normal subjects. Haemodialysis does not have an 
effect on the pharmacokinetics of loratadine or its active metabolite in subjects with 
chronic renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment
In patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, the AUC and peak plasma levels 
(Cmax) of loratadine were double while the pharmacokinetic profile of the active 
metabolite was not significantly changed from that in patients with normal liver 
function. The elimination half-lives for loratadine and its active metabolite were 24 
hours and 37 hours, respectively, and increased with increasing severity of liver 
disease. 
Elderly
The pharmacokinetic profile of loratadine and its active metabolite is comparable in 
healthy volunteers and in healthy geriatric volunteers. 
5.3 Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies 
of safety, pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic 
potential. 
In reproductive toxicity studies, no teratogenic effects were observed. However, 
prolonged parturition and reduced viability of offspring were observed in rats at 
plasma levels (AUC) 10 times higher than those achieved with clinical doses.

6. Contents of the pack and other information
Nasacort contains a medicine called triamcinolone acetonide. This belongs 
to a group of medicines called corticosteroids which means it is a type of 
steroid. It is given as a spray in the nose to treat the nasal symptoms of 
allergic rhinitis in adults and children 2 years of age and over.
Nasal symptoms of allergy include sneezing, itching, and having a blocked, 
stuffy or runny nose. These can be caused by things such as:
• Animal fur or house dust mites. This type of allergy can happen at any 
time of the year and is called ‘perennial allergic rhinitis’.
• Pollen. This type of allergy, such as hay fever, can be caused by 
different pollens in different seasons of the year. This is called 
‘seasonal allergic rhinitis’.
This medicine only works if used on a regular basis and may not help your 
symptoms straight away. It helps some people within the first day of 
treatment, however, for other people it may take 3 to 4 days to feel a relief.
Do not use Nasacort:
× If you are allergic to triamcinolone acetonide or any of the other
ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)
Signs of an allergic reaction to Nasacort include: a rash (hives), 
itching, swallowing or breathing problems, swelling of your lips,
face, throat or tongue.

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Nasacort:
 If you have any infection of the nose or throat that is not treated. If you 
get a fungal infection while using Nasacort, stop using the spray until 
the infection has been treated.
 If you have recently had a nose operation, or had an injury or ulcer in 
the nose.
 If you are being transferred from steroid injections or tablets to Nasacort 
spray.
 If you have had glaucoma or cataracts
If you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before using this medicine.
Contact your doctor if you experience blurred vision or other visual 
disturbances.
Children (under 2 years)
This medicine is not recommended for use in children under 2 years of age.
Operations or times of stress
Your doctor may advise you to take a higher than normal dose of this 
medicine for medical reasons. If your dose is increased, tell your
doctor if you are going to have an operation or are feeling unwell. This is 
because higher than normal doses of this medicine can lower your body's 
ability to heal or cope with stress. If this happens, your doctor may decide 
you need further treatment with another medicine to help.
Other medicines and Nasacort
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or 
might take any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a 
prescription. This is because Nasacort can affect the way some other 
medicines work. Also some medicines can affect the way Nasacort works.
Some medicines may increase the effects of Nasacort and your doctor may 
wish to monitor you carefully if you are taking these medicines (including 
some medicines for HIV: ritonavir, cobicistat).
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are 
planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before 
taking this medicine.
Driving and using machines
Nasacort has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use 
machines.
Nasacort contains benzalkonium chloride
This medicine contains 15 micrograms benzalkonium chloride in each 
spray. Benzalkonium chloride may cause irritation or swelling inside the 
nose, especially if used for a long time.
Systemic effects
When corticosteroids, including triamcinolone acetonide, are used for long 
periods of time or at high doses for long periods of time, side effects may 
occur due to the drug being absorbed in the body (e.g. the normal 
production of steroidal hormones may be affected). These side effects are 
much less likely to occur with corticosteroid nasal sprays than with 
corticosteroids taken orally (e.g. tablets). Talk to your doctor if you
experience any side effects.
NASACORT is for nasal use only.
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with 
your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. The medicine only works if it 
is used regularly. It can take 3 to 4 days before you notice your symptoms 
getting better.
How much Nasacort to use
Adults and children (over 12 years)
• The usual starting dose is 2 sprays in each nostril each day
• Once the symptoms of allergy are under control, the dose may be 
lowered to 1 spray in each nostril each day
Children (6 to 12 years)
• The usual dose is 1 spray in each nostril each day
• If the symptoms do not go away, then the dose may be increased to 2 
sprays in each nostril each day
• The dose can then be lowered again to 1 spray in each nostril each day
Children (2 to 5 years)
● The usual dose is 1 spray in each nostril each day
Do not use Nasacort for more than 3 months in children under 12 years old.
An adult should help a young child use this medicine.
How to use the spray
Before using your nasal spray, blow your nose gently to
clear your nostrils.
1. Preparing the bottle
• Remove the cap by pulling upward
• Shake the bottle gently before use
2. If you are using the spray for the first time
• Hold the bottle upright
• Point the spray away from you while doing this
• Fill the pump with spray by pressing the nozzle 
downwards. This is called priming
• Press and release it 5 times
• Do this until a fine spray is produced
• The spray is now ready to use
3. Using the spray
• Close one nostril with your finger
• Hold the bottle upright and put the nozzle into the
other nostril as far as is comfortable
• Breathe in gently through your nose with your 
mouth closed
• While you are doing this, press the nozzle to
deliver one spray
4. Then breath out through your mouth
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 if you have to spray again in
the same nostril and for the other nostril
6. After using the spray
• To keep the spray nozzle clean, wipe it carefully 
with a clean tissue or handkerchief after each use
• Replace the cap over the nozzle
If the nasal spray has not been used for more than 2 weeks:
• It needs to be primed again, to fill the nozzle with the spray
• The nozzle should be pointed away from you while you are doing this
• To prime, spray into the air once before use
• Always shake the bottle gently before use
Cleaning the spray
If the spray does not work, the nozzle may be blocked. 
Never try to unblock it or enlarge the tiny spray hole with
a pin or other sharp objects. This is because it can stop
the spray from working.
The nasal spray should be cleaned at least once a week.
It can be cleaned more often if it gets blocked.
Instructions for cleaning the spray:
1. Remove the cap
2. Gently pull off the spray nozzle only
3. Soak the cap and spray nozzle in warm water for a 
few minutes
4. Rinse under the cold running tap water
5. Shake or tap to remove any water that is left
6. Allow to dry in the air
7. Re-fit the spray nozzle
8. Prime the nasal spray until a fine mist is formed
9. Use as normal
If you use more Nasacort than you should
It is important that you take your dose as stated on the 
pharmacist's label or as advised by your doctor. You should
use only as much as your doctor recommends; using more 
or less may make your symptoms worse.
An overdose is unlikely to cause problems, however, if you 
have taken the entire contents of the bottle by mouth you 
may have stomach or gut discomfort. Talk to a doctor if you
use more Nasacort than you should.
If you forget to use Nasacort
If you have forgotten to use Nasacort, use it as soon as you remember. Do 
not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
 If you stop using Nasacort
 If you stop using this medicine, your symptoms may return within
 a few days.
If you experience any side effects (withdrawal symptoms) after stopping this 
medicine suddenly after prolonged use, talk to your doctor. See section 4 
‘Possible side effects’ for more information.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist. 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not 
everybody gets them.
 Stop using Nasacort and see a doctor or go to a hospital 
 straight away if:
• You have an allergic reaction to Nasacort. The signs (frequency 
not known) may include: a rash (hives), itching, swallowing or
breathing problems, swelling of your lips, face, throat or tongue.
Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)
• Runny nose, headache, sore throat and/or cough
• Nosebleeds
• Inflammation/irritation of the airways (bronchitis)
• Heartburn or indigestion
• Flu-like symptoms (fever, muscle pain, weakness and/or fatigue)
• Problems with teeth
Other side effects (Not known: frequency cannot be estimated from the 
available data)
• Irritation and dryness on the inside of your nose
• Sinuses become congested or blocked
• Sneezing
• Changes in the way things taste or smell
• Feeling sick (nausea)
• Sleeping problems, feeling dizzy or tired
• Shortness of breath (dyspnoea)
• A decrease in the levels of cortisol in the blood (lab value)
• Cloudiness of the lens in the eye (cataract), elevated pressure inside 
the eyeball (glaucoma)
• Blurred vision
• Sudden discontinuation of corticosteroids after prolonged use may 
result in withdrawal symptoms like joint pain, muscle pain, shaking, 
weight loss, anxiety, nasal drip and bleeding from the nose. However, 
these symptoms are extremely rare for corticosteroid nasal sprays, and 
much less likely to occur with corticosteroid nasal sprays than with 
corticosteroids taken orally (e.g. tablets).
In some people, Nasacort can cause damage to the middle part of the 
inside of the nose (called ‘nasal septum’). Discuss any worries you may 
have about this with your doctor or pharmaci"

5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
Otrivine Adult Nasal Spray is a sympathomimetic agent with marked alphaadrenergic activity, and is intended for use in the nose. It constricts the nasal 
blood vessels, thereby decongesting the mucosa of the nose and neighbouring 
regions of the pharynx. This enables patients suffering from colds to breathe 
more easily through the nose. The effect of Otrivine Adult Nasal Spray begins 
within a few minutes and lasts for up to 10 hours. Otrivine Adult Nasal Spray 
is generally well tolerated and does not impair the function of ciliated 
epithelium. 
In a double-blind, saline solution (Otrisal) controlled study in patients with 
common cold, the 
decongestant effect of Otrivin was significantly superior (p<0.0001) to Otrisal 
saline solution based on rhinomanometry measurement at 1 hour after 
administration of the study drugs. 
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties 
Systemic absorption may occur following nasal application of xylometazoline 
hydrochloride solutions. It is not used systemically. 
5.3 Preclinical safety data 
There are no findings in the preclinical testing which are of relevance to the 
prescriber.

1. WHAT BUSCOPAN CRAMPS IS AND WHAT
IT IS USED FOR
• BUSCOPAN CRAMPS is a tablet containing
hyoscine butylbromide. It belongs to a
group of medicines called antispasmodics.
• It is used to relieve stomach and bowel
cramps which cause pain and discomfort
associated with your digestive tract, and in
Irritable Bowel Syndrome.
• It may also be recommended by your doctor
for spasm of the bladder and urinary tubes
(urinary tract).
• It works by relaxing the cramping muscles
of your stomach and bowel, or urinary tract.
What are abdominal cramps?
Abdominal cramps (or spasm) are due to the
sudden, irregular tightening up of muscles in
the wall of your stomach or bowel. While the
precise cause is unknown, the muscles of the
stomach and bowel appear to be very
sensitive to things like:
• Stress, eating and drinking habits
• Food allergies or intolerances
• Stimulants such as coffee
• Hormonal factors
Such things can trigger painful abdominal
cramps or spasms if you have a sensitive
digestive tract. You may also feel bloated,
with excess wind and abdominal discomfort.
2. BEFORE YOU TAKE BUSCOPAN CRAMPS
Do not take BUSCOPAN CRAMPS if:
• You are allergic to hyoscine butylbromide or

sugars (as the tablet coating contains a
small amount of sucrose)
• You have glaucoma (an eye problem)
• You have something called ‘myasthenia
gravis’ (a very rare muscle weakness problem)
• You have a suspected or confirmed blockage
of the bowel

blocked and does not work properly
(paralytic or obstructive ileus). Symptoms
include severe abdominal pain with lack of
stools and/or nausea/vomiting
