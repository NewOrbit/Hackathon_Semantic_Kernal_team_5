• Chronic cough such as occurs with smoking, asthma, chronic bronchitis or 
emphysema. 
Use with caution in patients taking the following medications (see Interactions) 
• vasoconstrictor agents such as ergot alkaloids (e.g. ergotamine and methysergide) 
• digoxin and cardiac glycosides 
Patients should stop using the product and consult a health care professional if cough 
lasts for more than 5 days or comes back, or is accompanied by a fever, rash or 
persistent headache. 
Do not take with a cough suppressant. 
This product should not be used by patients taking other sympathomimetics (such as 
decongestants, appetite suppressants and amphetamine-like psychostimulants) 
Concomitant use with alcohol, should be avoided. 
If symptoms persist consult your doctor. 
Do not exceed the recommended dose. 
Keep out of the sight and reach of children. 
Special label warnings
Contains paracetamol. Do not take anything else containing paracetamol whilst taking 
this medicine. Do not take more medicine than the label tells you to. Talk to a doctor 
at once if you take too much of this medicine, even if you feel well. If you do not get 
better, talk to your doctor. 
Special leaflet warnings
Contains paracetamol. Talk to a doctor at once if you take too much of this medicine, 
even if you feel well. This is because too much paracetamol can cause delayed, 
serious liver damage. 
Contains sunset yellow (E110) which may cause allergic-type reactions. 
Contains sorbitol (E420): Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose 
intolerance should not take this medicine. 
This medicinal product contains 31 mg of sodium per dose. To be taken into 
consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet.

equivalent to 76 ml beer or 31.6 ml wine. 
Harmful for those suffering from alcoholism. 
To be taken into account in pregnant or breast-feeding women, children and high-risk 
groups such as patients with liver disease, or epilepsy. 
4.5 Interaction with other Medicinal products and Other Forms of 
Interaction 
The anticoagulant effect of warfarin and other coumarins may be enhanced by 
prolonged regular use of paracetamol with increased risk of bleeding; occasional 
doses have no significant effect. The hepato-toxicity of paracetamol may be 
potentiated by excessive intake of alcohol. The speed of absorption of paracetamol 
may be increased by metoclopramide or domperidone and absorption reduced by 
colestyramine. 
Pharmacological interactions involving paracetamol with a number of other drugs 
have been reported. These are considered to be of unlikely clinical significance in 
acute use at the dosage regimen proposed. 
Phenylephrine should be used with caution in combination with the following drugs 
as interactions have been reported: 
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
(including moclobemide) 
Hypertensive interactions occur between 
sympathomimetic amines such as 
phenylephrine and monoamine 
oxidase inhibitors (see contraindications). 
Sympathomimetic amines Concomitant use of phenylephrine with other 
sympathomimetic amines can increase the risk 
of cardiovascular side effects. 
Beta-blockers and other 
antihypertensives (including 
debrisoquine, guanethidine, 
reserpine, methyldopa) 
Phenylephrine may reduce the efficacy of betablocking drugs and antihypertensive drugs. 
The risk of hypertension and other 
cardiovascular side effects may be increased. 
Tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. 
amitriptyline) 
May increase the risk of cardiovascular side 
effects with phenylephrine. 
Ergot alkaloids 
(ergotamine and methylsergide) 
Increased risk of ergotism 
Digoxin and cardiac glycosides Increase the risk of irregular heartbeat or heart 
attack 
Warfarin and other coumarins The anticoagulant effect of warfarin and other 
coumarins may be enhanced by prolonged 
regular daily use of paracetamol with increased 
risk of bleeding; occasional doses have no 
significant effect. 
If urine is collected within 24 hours of a dose of this product, a metabolite may cause 
a colour interference with laboratory determinations of 5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-
HIAA) and vanillymandelic acid (VMA). 
4.6 Fertility, Pregnancy and lactation 
This product should not be used during pregnancy without medical advice. 
Epidemiological studies in human pregnancy have shown no ill effects due to 
paracetamol used in the recommended dosage, but patients should follow the advice 
of their doctor regarding its use. The safety of guaifenesin and phenylephrine during 
pregnancy has not been established. 
Paracetamol and phenylephrine are excreted in breast milk but not in a clinically 
significant amount. This product should not be used whilst breastfeeding without 
medical advice. 
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Patients should be advised not to drive or operate machinery if affected by dizziness. 
4.8 Undesirable effects 
Adverse events from historical clinical trial data are both infrequent and from small 
patient exposure. Events reported from extensive post-marketing experience at 
therapeutic/labelled dose and considered attributable are tabulated below by 
MedDRA System Organ Class. Due to limited clinical trial data, the frequency of 
these adverse events is not known (cannot be estimated from available data), but postmarketing experience indicates that adverse reactions to paracetamol are rare and 
serious reactions are very rare. 
Body System Undesirable effect 
Blood and 
lymphatic system

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is 
important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal 
product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions 
via the Yellow Card Scheme at www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard or search for MHRA 
Yellow Card in the Google Play or Apple App store. 
4.9 Overdose 
Paracetamol 
Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10g or more of paracetamol. 
Ingestion of 5g or more of paracetamol may lead to liver damage if the patient has 
risk factors (see below). 
Risk factors: If the patient 
a) Is on long term treatment with carbamazepine, phenobarbitone, phenytoin, 
primidone, rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes. 
Or 
b) Regularly consumes ethanol in excess of recommended amounts. 
Or 
c) Is likely to be glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV 
infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms:
Symptoms of paracetamol overdosage in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, 
vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 
hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis 
may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, 
haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema, and death. Acute renal failure with 
acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, 
may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and 
pancreatitis have been reported. 
Management:
Immediate treatment is essential in the management of paracetamol overdose, even if 
symptoms of overdose are not present. Despite a lack of significant early symptoms, 
patients should be referred to hospital urgently for immediate medical attention. 
Symptoms may be limited to nausea or vomiting and may not reflect the severity of 
overdose or the risk of organ damage. Management should be in accordance with 
established treatment guidelines, see BNF overdose section. 
Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been 
taken within 1 hour. Plasma paracetamol concentration should be measured at 4 hours 
or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with Nacetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of paracetamol, however, 
the maximum protective effect is obtained up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The 
effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply after this time. If required the patient 
should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage 
schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral methionine may be a suitable alternative 
for remote areas, outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious 
hepatic dysfunction beyond 24h from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or 
a liver unit. 
Phenylephrine 
Symptoms and signs
Phenylephrine overdosage is likely to result in effects similar to those listed under 
adverse reactions. Additional symptoms may include hypertension and possibly 
reflux bradycardia. In severe cases confusion, hallucinations, seizures and arrythmias 
may occur. However the amount required to produce serious phenylephrine toxicity 
would be greater than required to cause paracetamol-related toxicity. 
Treatment
Treatment should be as clinically appropriate. Severe hypertension may need to be 
treated with an alpha blocking drug such as phentolamine. 
Guaifenesin 
Symptoms and signs
Very large doses of guaifenesin cause nausea and vomiting. 
Treatment
Vomiting would be treated by fluid replacement and monitoring of electrolytes if 
indicated. 
5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
Paracetamol is an analgesic and antipyretic. 
Guaifenesin is an expectorant. 
Phenyleplrrine hydrochloride is a sympathomimimetic decongestant. 
The active ingredients are not known to cause sedation. 
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties 
Paracetamol is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is metabolised in the 
liver and excreted in the urine, mainly as glucuronide and sulphate conjugates. 
Guaifenesin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. It is rapidly metabolised by 
oxidation to β-(2 methoxy-phenoxy) lactic acid; which is excreted in the urine. 
Phenylephrine hydrochloride is irregularly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract 
and undergoes first-pass metabolism by monoamine oxidase in the gut and liver; 
orally administered phenylephrine thus has reduced bioavailability. It is excreted in 
the urine almost entirely as the sulphate conjugate. 
5.3 Preclinical safety data 
Preclinical safety data on these active ingredients in the literature have not revealed 
any pertinent and conclusive findings which are of relevance to the recommended 
dosage and use of the product and which have not already been mentioned elsewhere 
in this Summary.

cause liver failure which may require liver transplant or lead to death. 
The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease. 
Medical advice should be sought before taking this product in patients with these 
conditions: 
• Occlusive Vascular disease (e.g. Raynaud’s Phenomenon) 
• Glutathione depletion due to metabolic deficiencies 
Use with caution in patients taking the following medications (see interactions). 
• digoxin and cardiac glycosides 
• ergot alkaloids (e.g. ergotamine and methysergide) 
This product should not be used by patients taking other sympathomimetics (such as 
decongestants, appetite suppressants and amphetamine-like psychostimulants). 
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose 
malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.

Patients should be advised not to take other paracetamol-containing or any other cold, 
flu or decongestant products concurrently. 
Medical advice should sought if symptoms worsen, persist for more than 7 days, or 
are accompanied by high fever, skin rash or persistent headache. 
Keep out of the reach and sight of children. 
Special label warnings
Do not take with other flu, cold or decongestant products. Do not take with any other 
paracetamol-containing products. 
Immediate medical advice should be sought in the event of an overdose, even if you 
feel well. 
Special leaflet warnings
Immediate medical advice should be sought in the event of an overdose, even if you 
feel well, because of the risk of delayed, serious liver damage. 
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
The speed of absorption of paracetamol may be increased by metoclopramide 
or domperidone and absorption reduced by colestyramine. The anticoagulant 
effect of warfarin and other coumarins may be enhanced by prolonged regular 
daily use of paracetamol with increased risk of bleeding, occasional doses 
have no significant effect. 
Phenylephrine should be used with caution in combination with the following 
drugs as interactions have been reported. 
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
(including moclobemide) 
Hypertensive interactions occur 
between sympathomimetic amines 
such as phenylephrine and 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors (see 
contraindications). 
Sympathomimetic amines Concomitant use of phenylephrine 
with other sympathomimetic amines 
can increase the risk of cardiovascular 
side effects. 
Beta-blockers and other 
antihypertensives (including 
debrisoquine, guanethidine, reserpine, 
methyldopa) 
Phenylephrine may reduce the 
efficacy of beta-blocking drugs and 
antihypertensive drugs. The risk of 
hypertension and other cardiovascular 
side effects may be increased. 
Tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. 
amitriptyline) 
May increase the risk of 
cardiovascular side effects with 
phenylephrine. 
Ergot alkaloids (ergotamine and methylsergide) 
increased risk of ergotism 
Digoxin and cardiac glycosides Increase the risk of irregular heartbeat 
or heart attack 
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation 
Due to the phenylephrine content this product should not be used in pregnancy 
or whilst breast-feeding without medical advice. This product should not be 
used during pregnancy or lactation unless the expected benefit to the mother 
justifies the potential risk to the foetus or newborn. The lowest effective dose 
and shortest duration of treatment should be considered. Phenylephrine may be 
excreted in breast milk. 
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Patients should be advised not to drive or operate machinery if affected by 
dizziness. 
4.8 Undesirable effects 
Paracetamol 
Adverse events from historical clinical trial data are both infrequent and from 
small patient exposure. Accordingly, events reported from extensive postmarketing experience at therapeutic/labelled dose and considered attributable 
are tabulated below by system class. Due to limited clinical trial data, the 
frequency of these adverse events is not known (cannot be estimated from 
available data), but post-marketing experience indicates that adverse reactions 
to paracetamol are rare and serious reactions are very rare. 
Body System Undesirable effect 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders Thrombocytopenia, 
agranulocytosis. 
These are not necessarily causally 
related to paracetamol 
Immune system disorders Anaphylaxis, 
Cutaneous hypersensitivity 
reactions, including skin rashes, 
angioedema and Stevens Johnson 
syndrome / toxic epidermal 
necrolysis 
Very rare cases of serious skin 
reactions have been reported. 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders 
Bronchospasm* 
Hepatobiliary disorders Hepatic dysfunction 
* There have been cases of bronchospasm with paracetamol, but these are 
more likely in asthmatics sensitive to aspirin or other NSAIDs. 
Phenylephrine 
The following adverse events have been observed in clinical trials with 
phenylephrine and may therefore represent the most commonly occurring 
adverse events. 
Body System Undesirable effect 
Psychiatric disorders Nervousness, irritability, restlessness, and 
excitability 
Nervous system disorders Headache, dizziness, insomnia 
Cardiac disorders Increased blood pressure 
Gastrointestinal disorders Nausea, Vomiting. 
Adverse reactions identified during post-marketing use are listed below. The 
frequency of these reactions is unknown but likely to be rare. 
Eye disorders Mydriasis, acute angle closure glaucoma, 
most likely to occur in those with closed 
angle glaucoma 
Cardiac disorders Tachycardia, palpitations 
Skin and subcutaneous 
disorders 
Allergic reactions (e.g. rash, urticaria, 
allergic dermatitis). Hypersensitivity 
reactions – including that cross-sensitivity 
may occur with other sympathomimetics 
Renal and urinary disorders Dysuria, urinary retention. This is most likely 
to occur in those with bladder outlet 
obstruction, such as prostatic hypertrophy. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal 
product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance 
of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any 
suspected adverse reactions via the Yellow Card Scheme at 
www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the 
Google Play or Apple App store. 
4.9 Overdose 
Paracetamol
Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10g or more of 
paracetamol. Ingestion of 5g or more of paracetamol may lead to liver damage 
if the patient has risk factors (see below). 
Risk factors: 
If the patient 
a. Is on long term treatment with carbamazepine, phenobarbitone, phenytoin, 
primidone, rifampicin, St John's Wort or other drugs that induce liver 
enzymes. 
OR 
b. Regularly consumes ethanol in excess of recommended amounts. 
OR 
c. Is likely to be glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV 
infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms: 
Symptoms of paracetamol overdosage in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, 
vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 
12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and 
metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may 
progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema, 
and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested 
by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of 
severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. 
Management: 
Immediate treatment is essential in the management of paracetamol overdose. 
Despite a lack of significant early symptoms, patients should be referred to 
hospital urgently for immediate medical attention. Symptoms may be limited 
to nausea or vomiting and may not reflect the severity of overdose or the risk 
of organ damage. Management should be in accordance with established 
treatment guidelines, see BNF overdose section. 
Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has 
been taken within 1 hour. Plasma paracetamol concentration should be 
measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are 
unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after 
ingestion of paracetamol, however, the maximum protective effect is obtained 
up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines 
sharply after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous Nacetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not 
a problem, oral methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, 
outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic 
dysfunction beyond 24 hours from ingestion should be discussed with the 
NPIS or a liver unit. 
Phenylephrine Hydrochloride
Symptoms and signs:
Phenylephrine overdosage is likely to result in effects similar to those listed 
under adverse reactions. Additional symptoms may include hypertension and 
possibly reflux bradycardia. In severe cases confusion, hallucinations, seizures 
and arrythmias may occur. However the amount required to produce serious 
phenylephrine toxicity would be greater than required to cause paracetamolrelated toxicity. 
Treatment
Treatment should be as clinically appropriate. Severe hypertension may need 
to be treated with an alpha blocking drug such as phentolamine. 
5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
Paracetamol provides the analgesic and antipyretic actions. 
Phenylephrine Hydrochloride is a sympathomimetic agent and provides relief 
from nasal congestion due to its vasoconstrictor action. 
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties 
Paracetamol - Is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is 
metabolised in the liver and excreted in the urine, mainly as glucuronide and 
sulphate conjugates. 
Phenylephrine Hydrochloride - Due to irregular absorption and first pass 
metabolism by monoamine oxidase in the gut and liver, phenylephrine has 
reduced bioavailability from the gastrointestinal tract. It is excreted in the 
urine almost entirely as the sulphate conjugate. 
5.3 Preclinical safety data 
None stated.

4.3 Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to paracetamol, caffeine or any of the other constituents. 
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take this 
medicine. 
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
Do not exceed the stated dose. 
Contains paracetamol. Do not use with any other paracetamol containing 
products. The concomitant use with other products containing paracetamol may 
lead to an overdose. 
Paracetamol overdose may cause liver failure which may require liver transplant 
or lead to death. 
Care is advised in the administration of paracetamol to patients with renal or 
hepatic impairment. The hazard of overdose is greater in those with non-cirrhotic 
alcoholic liver disease. 
Caution should be exercised in patients with glutathione depleted states, as the 
use of paracetamol may increase the risk of metabolic acidosis (see section 4.9). 
Excessive intake of caffeine (e.g. coffee, tea and some canned drinks) should be 
avoided while taking this product. 
This medicinal product contains 854 mg sodium per dose (2 tablets) equivalent to 
42.7% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an 
adult. 
Each tablet contains sorbitol powder (E 420) at 50 mg per tablet. 
Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance should not take this medicine. 
If symptoms persist, medical advice must be sought. 
Keep out of the sight and reach of children. 
Pack Label:
Talk to a doctor at once if you take too much of this medicine, even if you feel 
well. Do not take anything else containing paracetamol while taking this 
medicine. 
Patient Information Leaflet:
Talk to a doctor at once if you take too much of this medicine even if you feel 
well. This is because too much paracetamol can cause delayed, serious liver 
damage. 
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
The speed of absorption of paracetamol may be increased by metaclopramide or 
domperidone and absorption reduced by colestyramine. The anticoagulant effect of 
warfarin and other coumarins may be enhanced by prolonged regular daily use of 
paracetamol with increased risk of bleeding; occasional doses have no significant 
effect. Caffeine may increase clearance of lithium. Concomitant use is therefore not 
recommended. 
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation 
Paracetamol-caffeine is not recommended for use during pregnancy due to the 
possible increased risk of lower birth weight and spontaneous abortion 
associated with caffeine consumption. 
Caffeine in breast milk may potentially have a stimulating effect on breast fed 
infants. 
Due to the caffeine content of this product it should not be used if you are 
pregnant or breast feeding. 
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
None. 
4.8 Undesirable effects 
Adverse events from historical clinical trial data are both infrequent and from small 
patient exposure. Accordingly, events reported from extensive post- marketing 
experience at therapeutic/labelled dose and considered attributable are tabulated 
below by MedDRA System Organ Class. Adverse reactions identified during post-
marketing use are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, the 
frequency of these reactions is unknown but likely to be very rare (<1/10,000).

Yellow Card in the Google Play or Apple App store. 
4.9 Overdose 
Paracetamol
Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10 g or more of paracetamol. 
Ingestion of 
5g or more of paracetamol may lead to liver damage if the patient has risk factors (see 
below).
Risk factors 
If the patient 
a) Is on long term treatment with carbamazepine, phenobarbitone, phenytoin, 
primidone, rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver enzymes. 
or 
 
b) Regularly consumes ethanol in excess of recommended amounts. 
or 
c) Is likely to be glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV 
infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms 
Symptoms of paracetamol overdose in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, vomiting, 
anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 12 to 48 hours 
after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and metabolic acidosis may 
occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may progress to encephalopathy, 
haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema and death. Acute renal failure with 
acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, 
may develop even in the absence of severe liver damage. Cardiac arrythmias and

Immediate treatment is essential in the management of paracetamol overdose. 
Despite a lack of significant early symptoms, patients should be referred to hospital 
urgently for immediate medical attention. Symptoms may be limited to nausea or 
vomiting and may not reflect the severity of the overdose or the risk of organ damage. 
Management should be in accordance with established treatment guidelines, see BNF 
overdose section. 
Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has been 
taken within 1 hour. Plasma paracetamol concentration should be measured at 4 hours 
or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are unreliable). Treatment with Nacetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after ingestion of paracetamol, however,

should be given intravenous N-acetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage 
schedule. If vomiting is not a problem, oral methionine may be a suitable alternative 
for remote areas outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious 
hepatic dysfunction beyond 24 h from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or 
a liver unit. 
Caffeine
Symptoms 
Overdose of caffeine may result in epigastric pain, vomitting, diuresis, tachycardia or 
cardia arrhythmia, CNS stimulation (insomnia, restlessness, excitement, agitation, 
jitteriness, tremors and convulsions). 
It must be noted that for clinically significant symptoms of caffeine overdose to occur 
with this product, the amount ingested would be associated with serious paracetamolrelated toxicity 
Management 
Patients should receive general supportive care (e.g. hydration and maintenance of 
vital signs). The administration of activated charcoal may be beneficial when 
performed within one hour of the overdose, but can be considered for up to four hours 
after the overdose. The CNS effects of overdose may be treated with intravenous 
sedatives. 
Sodium bicarbonate
High doses of sodium bicarbonate may be expected to induce gastrointestinal 
symptoms including belching and nausea. In addition, high doses of sodium 
bicarbonate may cause hypernatraemia; electrolytes should be monitored and patients 
managed accordingly. 
5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
The combination of paracetamol and caffeine is a well established analgesic 
combination. 
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties 
Paracetamol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastro-intestinal 
tract. It is relatively uniformly distributed throughout most body fluids and exhibits 
variable protein binding. Excretion is almost exclusively renal in the form of 
conjugated metabolites. 
Caffeine is absorbed readily after oral administration, maximal plasma concentrations 
are achieved within one hour and the plasma half-life is about 3.5 hours. 65 -–80% of 
administered caffeine is excreted in the urine as 1-methyluric acid and 1-
methylxanine. 
5.3 Preclinical safety data 
There are no preclinical data of relevance to the prescriber which are additional to 
that already included in other sections of the SPC.

Immediate medical advice should be sought in the event of an overdose, even 
if you feel well. 
Special leaflet warnings
Immediate medical advice should be sought in the event of an overdose, even 
if you feel well, because of the risk of delayed, serious liver damage. 
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
The speed of absorption of paracetamol may be increased by metoclopramide 
or domperidone and absorption reduced by colestyramine. The anticoagulant 
effect of warfarin and other coumarins may be enhanced by prolonged regular 
daily use of paracetamol with increased risk of bleeding, occasional doses 
have no significant effect. 
Phenylephrine should be used with caution in combination with the following 
drugs as interactions have been reported 
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
(including moclobemide) 
Hypertensive interactions occur 
between sympathomimetic amines 
such as phenylephrine and monoamine 
oxidase inhibitors (see 
contraindications). 
Sympathomimetic amines Concomitant use of phenylephrine 
with other sympathomimetic amines 
can increase the risk of cardiovascular 
side effects. 
Beta-blockers and other 
antihypertensives (including 
debrisoquine, guanethidine, 
reserpine, methyldopa) 
Phenylephrine may reduce the efficacy 
of beta-blocking drugs and 
antihypertensive drugs. The risk of 
hypertension and other cardiovascular 
side effects may be increased. 
Tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. 
amitriptyline) 
May increase the risk of 
cardiovascular side effects with 
phenylephrine. 
Ergot alkaloids (ergotamine and methylsergide) 
increased risk of ergotism 
Digoxin and cardiac glycosides Increase the risk of irregular heartbeat 
or heart attack 
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation 
Due to the phenylephrine content this product should not be used in pregnancy 
or whilst breast-feeding without medical advice. This product should not be 
used during pregnancy or lactation unless the expected benefit to the mother 
justifies the potential risk to the foetus or newborn. The lowest effective dose 
and shortest duration of treatment should be considered. Phenylephrine may 
be excreted in breast milk. 
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Patients should be advised not to drive or operate machinery if affected by dizziness. 
4.8 Undesirable effects 
Paracetamol
Adverse events from historical clinical trial data are both infrequent 
and from small patient exposure. Accordingly, events reported 
from extensive post- marketing experience at therapeutic/labelled 
dose and considered attributable are tabulated below by system 
class. Due to limited clinical trial data, the frequency of these 
adverse events is not known (cannot be estimated from available 
data), but post-marketing experience indicates that adverse 
reactions to paracetamol are rare and serious reactions are very 
rare. 
Body System Undesirable effect
Blood and lymphatic system 
disorders 
Thrombocytopenia 
Agranulocytosis 
These are not necessarily causally related to 
paracetamol 
Immune system disorders Anaphylaxis
Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions 
including skin rashes, angioedema and 
Stevens Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal 
necrolysis 
Very rare cases of serious skin reactions have 
been reported. 
Respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders 
Bronchospasm in patients sensitive to 
aspirin and other NSAIDs 
Hepatobiliary disorders Hepatic dysfunction 
* There have been cases of bronchospasm with paracetamol, but these are 
more likely in asthmatics sensitive to aspirin or other NSAIDs. 
Phenylephrine
The following adverse events have been observed in clinical 
trials with phenylephrine and may therefore represent the most 
commonly occurring adverse events. 
Body System Undesirable effect
Psychiatric disorders Nervousness, irritability, restlessness, and 
excitability 
Nervous system disorders Headache, dizziness, insomnia 
Cardiac disorders Increased blood pressure 
Gastrointestinal disorders Nausea, Vomiting, diarrhoea 
Adverse reactions identified during post-marketing use are listed 
below. The frequency of these reactions is unknown but likely to 
be rare. 
Eye disorders Mydriasis, acute angle closure glaucoma, 
most likely to occur in those with closed 
angle glaucoma 
Cardiac disorders Tachycardia, palpitations 
Skin and subcutaneous 
disorders 
Allergic reactions (e.g. rash, urticaria, 
allergic dermatitis). 
Hypersensitivity reactions – including that 
cross-sensitivity may occur with other 
sympathomimetics 
Renal and urinary disorders Dysuria, urinary retention. This is most 
likely to occur in those with bladder outlet 
obstruction, such as prostatic hypertrophy. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal 
product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk 
balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report 
any suspected adverse reactions via the Yellow Card Scheme at 
www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the 
Google Play or Apple App store. 
4.9 Overdose 
Paracetamol
Liver damage is possible in adults who have taken 10g or more of 
paracetamol. Ingestion of 5g or more of paracetamol may lead to liver damage 
if the patient has risk factors (see below). 
Risk factors:
If the patient 
a, Is on long term treatment with carbamazepine, phenobarbitone, phenytoin, 
primidone, rifampicin, St John’s Wort or other drugs that induce liver 
enzymes. 
Or 
b, Regularly consumes ethanol in excess of recommended amounts. 
Or 
c, Is likely to be glutathione deplete e.g. eating disorders, cystic fibrosis, HIV 
infection, starvation, cachexia. 
Symptoms:
Symptoms of paracetamol overdosage in the first 24 hours are pallor, nausea, 
vomiting, anorexia and abdominal pain. Liver damage may become apparent 
12 to 48 hours after ingestion. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and 
metabolic acidosis may occur. In severe poisoning, hepatic failure may 
progress to encephalopathy, haemorrhage, hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema, 
and death. Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, strongly suggested 
by loin pain, haematuria and proteinuria, may develop even in the absence of 
severe liver damage. Cardiac arrhythmias and pancreatitis have been reported. 
Management:
Immediate treatment is essential in the management of paracetamol overdose. 
Despite a lack of significant early symptoms, patients should be referred to 
hospital urgently for immediate medical attention. Symptoms may be limited 
to nausea or vomiting and may not reflect the severity of overdose or the risk 
of organ damage. Management should be in accordance with established 
treatment guidelines, see BNF overdose section. 
Treatment with activated charcoal should be considered if the overdose has 
been taken within 1 hour. Plasma paracetamol concentration should be 
measured at 4 hours or later after ingestion (earlier concentrations are 
unreliable). Treatment with N-acetylcysteine may be used up to 24 hours after 
ingestion of paracetamol, however, the maximum protective effect is obtained 
up to 8 hours post-ingestion. The effectiveness of the antidote declines sharply 
after this time. If required the patient should be given intravenous Nacetylcysteine, in line with the established dosage schedule. If vomiting is not 
a problem, oral methionine may be a suitable alternative for remote areas, 
outside hospital. Management of patients who present with serious hepatic 
dysfunction beyond 24h from ingestion should be discussed with the NPIS or 
a liver unit. 
Phenylephrine
Symptoms and signs
Phenylephrine overdosage is likely to result in effects similar to those listed 
under advserse reactions. Additional symptoms may include hypertension and 
possibly reflux bradycardia. In severe cases confusion, hallucinations, seizures 
and arrythmias may occur. However the amount required to produce serious 
phenylephrine toxicity would be greater than required to cause paracetamolrelated toxicity. 
Treatment
Treatment should be as clinically appropriate. Severe hypertension may need 
to be treated with an alpha blocking drug such as phentolamine. 
Ascorbic acid
Symptoms and signs
High doses of ascorbic acid (>3000 mg) may cause transient osmotic 
diarrhoea and gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and abdominal 
discomfort. Effects of overdose of ascorbic acid would be subsumed by severe 
liver toxicity caused by paracetamol overdose. 
Pharmacological Properties 
5.1. Pharmacodynamic Properties 
Paracetamol - an analgesic and antipyretic. 
Ascorbic acid - a common ingredient of cold and influenza combination 
products included to compensate for Vitamin C losses which may occur in the 
initial stages of acute viral infections. 
Phenylephrine hydrochloride - a sympathomimetic decongestant. 
The active ingredients are not known to cause sedation. 
5.2. Pharmacokinetic Properties 
Paracetamol - is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is 
metabolised in the liver and excreted in the urine, mainly as glucuronide and 
sulphate conjugates. 
Ascorbic Acid - is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is 
widely distributed in the body tissues, 25% bound to plasma proteins. 
Ascorbic Acid in excess of the body's needs is eliminated in the urine as 
metabolites. 
Phenylephrine hydrochloride - is irregularly absorbed from the gastrointestinal 
tract and undergoes first-pass metabolism by monoamine oxidase in the gut 
and liver; orally administered phenylephrine thus has reduced bioavailability. 
It is excreted in the urine almost entirely as the sulphate conjugate. 
5.3. Preclinical Safety Data 
Pre-clinical safety data on these active ingredients in the literature have not 
revealed any pertinent and conclusive findings which are of relevance to the 
recommended dosage and use of the product and which have not already been 
mentioned elsewhere in this Summary 
The toxicity of paracetamol has been extensively studied in numerous animal 
species. Pre-clinical studies in rats and mice have indicated single dose oral 
LD50 values of 3.7 g/kg and 338 mg/kg, respectively. Chronic toxicity in 
these species at large multiples of the human therapeutic dose, occurs as 
degeneration and necrosis of hepatic, renal and lymphoid tissue, and blood 
count changes. The metabolites believed responsible for these effects have 
also been demonstrated in man. Paracetamol should not, therefore, be taken 
for long periods of time, and in excessive doses. At normal therapeutic doses, 
paracetamol is not associated with genotoxic or carcinogenic risk. There is no 
evidence of embryo- or foeto-toxicity from paracetamol in animal studies.
